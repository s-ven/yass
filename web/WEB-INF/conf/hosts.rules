# This is the rules files for how connection checking
# will be handled.
#
# A rule is a sign followed by an address.
# Addresses can be numerical as well. 
# Only one rule per line.
#
# A + sign in front of an address means that this host
# is allowed to connect.
# A - sign in front of an address means that this host
# is not allowed to connect.
# The ALL rule specifies how to handle connections in 
# general.
